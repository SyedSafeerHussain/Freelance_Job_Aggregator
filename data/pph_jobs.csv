Salesforce Integration Demo - Apex-compatible AES decryption function - Example Apex callout to the API with decryption logic - Key should be stored securely using Named Credentials or Encrypted Custom Settings 4. Documentation - Instructions for API deployment - How to encrypt new prompt strings - How to call and decrypt within Salesforce 5. Security Requirements - Prompt strings must never be transmitted or stored as plaintext - AES-256 encryption with CBC or GCM mode - Secure API access via token or key - Key must not be hardcoded in Apex 6. Tech Stack Preferences - API in Node.js - Salesforce integration using Apex Bonus if you have experience with Salesforce integrations and encryption libraries _____ API Specification Endpoint GET /prompt?id={agent_id} Security - HTTPS required - Token authentication required - Rate limiting preferred Apex Decryption Class - The IV can either be sent separately or prepended to the encrypted string - The key should be securely stored in Salesforce (e.g., Named Credential or Encrypted Custom Setting) - The API must ensure the ciphertext is formatted to be compatible with Salesforce’s Crypto.decrypt() function",https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelance-jobs/technology-programming/programming-coding/encrypted-prompt-delivery-api-for-salesforce-node-apex-4386217,$888

Tracking Session Time on Teachable,"I’m looking for a developer to create a custom embed code that connects to the Teachable API. The purpose is to track and display the total connection time (i.e., the total time a student has spent on the platform), which is a legal requirement for selling online courses in my location. Key Features Needed: • A search bar where a student's email can be entered. • A display showing chronological connection sessions, including: o Start time o End time o Total connection time • Example format: Inicio de Conexión: 22.03.2025 15:03 Fin de Conexión: 22.03.2025 17:03 Inicio de Conexión: 25.03.2025 11:33 Fin de Conexión: 25.03.2025 11:43 Conexión Total: 1h10m Important Notes: • Teachable does not natively provide this feature but you can use code snippets for example (photo) • I need to embed this code on my Teachable site so that students can view their own connection time. (by embedding code I mean copying code and embedding on web like google form, if there is something to add to server this must be done by you since im not a computer-man) • I have a Professional Plan on Teachable and I can provide the API Key.

Info I get from Teachable bot when asking about snippet: Code snippets can track when students are logged in or out, but they're not designed to measure total logged-in time. Our Logged In Snippets section lets you add code that runs only for logged-in users, while Logged Out Snippets run for users who aren't logged in.

Tracking Session Time on Teachable,"I’m looking for a developer to create a custom embed code that connects to the Teachable API. The purpose is to track and display the total connection time (i.e., the total time a student has spent on the platform), which is a legal requirement for selling online courses in my location. Key Features Needed: • A search bar where a student's email can be entered. • A display showing chronological connection sessions, including: o Start time o End time o Total connection time • Example format: Inicio de Conexión: 22.03.2025 15:03 Fin de Conexión: 22.03.2025 17:03 Inicio de Conexión: 25.03.2025 11:33 Fin de Conexión: 25.03.2025 11:43 Conexión Total: 1h10m Important Notes: • Teachable does not natively provide this feature but you can use code snippets for example (photo) • I need to embed this code on my Teachable site so that students can view their own connection time. (by embedding code I mean copying code and embedding on web like google form, if there is something to add to server this must be done by you since im not a computer-man) • I have a Professional Plan on Teachable and I can provide the API Key. Please let me know if you understand the requirement and if you have a solution or past experience with Teachable’s API/code snippets/other workaround. Teachable documentation: https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/222808927-Webhooks-and-API Maybe you can achieve what I need by using the Teachable feature of Code Snippets (Log in and Log out Snippet)? Info I get from Teachable bot when asking about snippet: Code snippets can track when students are logged in or out, but they're not designed to measure total logged-in time. Our Logged In Snippets section lets you add code that runs only for logged-in users, while Logged Out Snippets run for users who aren't logged in. However, these snippets fire when pages load, not continuously during a session.",https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelance-jobs/technology-programming/programming-coding/tracking-session-time-on-teachable-4386863,$211
